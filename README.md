# 503Errorpage
A Custom Error page for 503 server errors. This error actually helps Animals from Adopt A Pet. 
These cats were generated with AI and are free to use in whole or in part.
The 503 code is in HTML and also is responsive meaning it will fit perfectly in a cellphone or tablet or giant web TV screen like Im using now.
This can be used in HAProxy as I am using just create a new file called 503error or whatever you want.
Enjoy
